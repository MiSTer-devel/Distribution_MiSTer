# MiSTer Port of Game and Watch Games

The Game and Watch handheld devices emulator for MiSTer FPGA by Pierco.

Place your ROMs into the folder "/media/fat/games/GameNWatch".

This is still a work in progress:

- RTC is not working yet.
- SM5A is not implemented.
- SM511 is not implemented.
- Timing is not perfect.
- Two screen games have problems with anti-aliasing.

The core comes with a ROM generator so in theory, it could be possible to create new Game and Watch games. A SM510 assembler exists here: https://github.com/trevorjay/marios-binary-factory

It has been reported that some non-Nintendo games are working: Konami Top Gun, Konami Double Dribble and probably other ones.

I would like to thank Tonton for helping me generate the games!! Pre-compiled games are available on archive.org:

If you would like to convert games yourself, read the manual in the Tools directory.

A big thank you to all my Patreon contributors!!
