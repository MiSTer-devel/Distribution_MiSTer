# [Magnavox Odyssey2/Videopac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey_2) for [MiSTer Platform](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) 

### This is an FPGA implementation of the Magnavox Odyssey2/Videopac G7000 based on FPGA videopac by Arnim Laeuger and ported to MiSTer (With additional work from wsoltys) by [Kitrinx](https://github.com/Kitrinx).

## Features
 * Switch between Odyssey2 and Videopac mode.
 * Switch between two palettes (composite RF emulation and RGB for more vivid colours)
 * Fully working keyboard.
 * Joystick buttons for keys 0-9.
 * loadable **VDC ROM charset** for some custom roms. For information, how-to prepare them and examples read the [manual](https://github.com/RW-FPGA-devel-Team/Videopac-G7000/tree/main/doc/Charset%20Edit). Also have some ready to use [custom roms](https://github.com/RW-FPGA-devel-Team/Videopac-G7000/tree/main/custom_roms).
 * Correct Sound, timings and better collision detection.
 * "The Voice" peripheral.
 * available on:
   * **MiSTer** (on official updates)
   * **MiST**
   * **SiDi**
   * **Neptuno**
   * **Unamiga Reloaded**
   * **ZxDOS**
   * **ZX Next** (Soon)
 

## Installation
Copy the *.rbf file to your SD card. Create an **Oddysey** folder on the card, and place Odyssey2/Videopac roms (\*.BIN) inside this folder. XROM dumps (at the moment only known Musician and 4 in a row) must be renamed to \*.rom.

When loading a ROM, most games will prompt the user with "SELECT GAME". Press 0-9 on the keyboard or mapped controller button to play the game. Unfortunately, there is no on-screen display of the game options, so looking at the [instruction manuals](https://videopac.ch/) may be helpful in selecting a game. Note that the system did not have a well defined player 1 or player 2 controller, they would alternate on a game-to-game basis. You may need to swap controllers to use the correct joystick.

## Known Issues

* Still a few graphic glitches.
