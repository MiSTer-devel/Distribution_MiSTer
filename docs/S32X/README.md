## Region detection
Region detection is known to work for all commercially released 32X games except the following. These are not bugs, this is due to the way the games were developed and due to the nature of the region code system in Sega Genesis games in general:

* Shadow Squadron ~ Stellar Assault (USA, Europe) always initially boots to Europe region. The ROM header has "E" (Europe) for the region, so the developers set it to the european region, you will have to set the region manually.
* FIFA Soccer 96 (Europe) and Mortal Kombat II (Europe) boot to US/JP Region. Header has the "JUE" (Region-Free) region code, so just set your region priority.
