# Acorn Electron

Port by David Wood - oldgit

## Introduction

This is a port of [ElctronFPGA](https://github.com/hoglet67/ElectronFpga) by David Banks, Mike Sterling. They have a good
description of the project here:   [Acorn Electron FPGA Project](https://www.mups.co.uk/post/2017/07/acorn-electron-fpga-project/)


I used the front end for the BBC Micro by Sorgelig and adapted it for this port.

As usual with a first port from me it's not perfect. It is fixed in 60hz video
my clumsy attempt at having a variable video clock is not working yet.

On start up you will need to ctrl-Break to clear the garbage on the screen. -- fix me

Put the Electron version of beeb.mb in games as boot.vhd (Acorn Electron Games & Magazines BEEB.MMB)


I cannot get used to the Func Number for Function Keys. -- Func = Caps Lock


I never had an Electron and the only time I saw one was when it was being used as a door stop
in the 'One Step Beyond' shop in Norwich.
