# VZ Loader

Load VZ snapshots - there are two types, basic images and binary images. The basic images will load, and you need to type RUN&lt;enter&gt; to start. Binary ones should start automatically.

# Joystick Support

The original system has a left and right joystick. It is possible you may need a second joystick to play some games.

# TODO
