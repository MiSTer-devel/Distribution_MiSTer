# [Apple IIe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIe) for [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)

This is a MiSTer port of the Apple IIe core from MiST.

## Description

This the MiST port of a reconstruction of an 1980s-era Apple ]\[+ implemented in VHDL for FPGAs.  
Original for the DE2: http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/apple2fpga/  
Port for the MiST: http://ws0.org/tag/apple2/

## Features

* disk loading via osd (no write support yet) supported formats: .nib, .dsk, .do, .po
* HDD loading via osd
* Tape loading via the ADC-in
* Selectable 6502 or 65C02 CPU
* joystick support
* scanlines
* color, amber, green and black&white monitor
* language card in slot 0
* 64K base + 64K auxilary RAM with 80 column and double hi-res support (256KB total with Saturn 128K)
* Saturn 128k RAM expansion in slot 5 (get the utility disks from here: http://apple2online.com/?page_id=3447 , under "Saturn RAMSoft")
* Mockingboard model A (two AY-3-8913 chips for six audio channels) in slot 4

## Disk format notes

Apple-II has a big mess in disk formats. DSK image may contain either DO or PO format. Even PO and DO may contain opposite format. So if PO disk doesn't work, then try to rename it to DO. If DO or DSK doesn't work then try to rename it to PO.

For HDD, only HDV images (raw ProDOS partition images) 32MB in size are supported. 2MG images may work if the 64-byte header is removed.
```bash
dd if=diskimage.2mg of=diskimage.hdv bs=64 skip=1
```


## Instructions

Put disk files into the `/games/Apple-II/` folder.

On the "Apple ][" boot screen open the OSD with F12 and choose a disk. It will boot the disk automatically. 

If you press reset (the right button on the MiST) you'll enter Applesoft with the ] prompt.
From here you have some limited commands. See: http://www.landsnail.com/a2ref.htm

If you want to boot another disk choose a .nib image via the osd and type the following:

```
]PR#6
```

or

```
]CALL -151`
*C600G
```

The call command will enter the Monitor. Type the call a second time if the * prompt won't
show the first time. 
At the Monitor you can also type 6 and then Ctrl-P followed by return.
See https://web.archive.org/web/20140827184511/http://vectronicsappleworld.com:80/appleii/dos.html#bootdos

The HDD interface is in slot 7. Unlike the floppy interface, it does not stall until an image is mounted, so either reset the machine or use one of the following after mounting an image:

```
]PR#7
```

or

```
]CALL -151`
*C700G
```

------------------------------
The current implementation uses the Altera DE2 board and takes advantage
of its off-chip SRAM, VGA DAC, SD card, audio CODEC, and PS/2 keyboard
interface. 

It was designed to be fairly easy to port: the apple2.vhd file should
be implementation-agnostic: it only assumes the external availability
of 48K of RAM and a keyboard.

It contains a simple read-only Disk II emulator that expects
"nibblized" disk images written raw onto an SD or MMC card (i.e., it
does not use a FAT or any other type of filesystem).

The VGA controller (not part of an original Apple) doubles each line
and interprets the Apple's NTSC-compatible color signals to produce a color
640 X 480 VGA display with non-standard dot timing.
------------------------------
To compile under Altera's Quartus software, open the apple2fpga.qpf
project file and compile.

------------------------------
Disk images

The system expects a sequence of "nibblized" (227K) disk images on the
SD card starting at block 0.  Switches on the DE2 board selects which
image appears to be in the drive; the image number is displayed in hex
on two of the seven-segment displays.

Most Apple II disk images are in 140K .dsk files, which stores only
the disk's logical data, i.e., is not encoded.  dsk2nib.c is a small C
program that expands .dsk files to .nib files.

I used the "makenibs" script to find all the .dsk files in a tree of
directories, assemble them into an image suitable for downloading to
the SD card, and print an image number/file name cross-listing.

To write .nib images to an SD/MMC card under Linux, I use

dd if=dos33master.nib of=/dev/sdd

Of course, your card may appear as something other than /dev/sdd.
------------------------------
ROMs

This archive does NOT include a copy of the Apple ][+'s ROMs, which
are copyright Apple Computer.  Instead, it includes a very trivial
BIOS that beeps, displays a text screen, then cycles through some
lores and hires graphics patterns when keys are pressed.  This should
be enough to verify the graphics, sound, and keyboard are working (but
not the disk emulator).  Source for this BIOS is in the bios.a65 file,
which I assembled using the xa65 cross-assembler.

The system requires two ROM images: a 12K image of the system roms
(memory from 0xD000 - 0xFFFF) and a 256-byte image of the Disk II
controller bootstrap ROM (memory from 0xc600 - 0xc6ff if the card is
in the usual slot 6).

Once you obtain them, run the "rom2vhdl" script to convert the binary
files into .vhd files that hold the data.  The Makefile contains rules
for doing this.
