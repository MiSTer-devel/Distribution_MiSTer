# Watara Supervision for MiSTer
Based upon initial work by Pierco, rewritten by Jamie Blanks.

An implementation of the unfortunate GameBoy clone, the Watara SuperVision. No boot ROMs are required and there is no additional setup.

This core is compatible with gameboy palettes which can be found with the GameBoy core.

The full game library is supported, including the rare "Journey to the West".

The USER_IO port for this core outputs the link port pins, but I know of nothing that uses them.

## Special Thanks
A special thank you to Osman Celimli for his very thorough reverse engineering notes and personal help in getting this core accurate.
