# Bandai RX-78

Bandai RX-78 core for MiSTer FPGA by Pierco (Pierre Cornier) & Alanswx (Alan Steremberg).

I would like to thank Reenthused (Johnny Blanchard) and Hubz (Dustin Hubbard) for their help and for taking their RX-78 apart for me.

## About the core

There's no cassette support yet.

For 32k cartridge support, please activate the EXT RAM in OSD.

To do list:
- Fix the choppy sound on Gundam title screen.
- Add cassette support and ADC in.
- Add game identification mechanism to support for different joystick mappings.
- Identify & implement the missing I/O ports.
- VGA output works but hsync timing seems wrong.
