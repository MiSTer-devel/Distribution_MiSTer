# [Super Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Game_Boy) for [MiSTer Platform](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)
 
Based on the [SNES core](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/SNES_MiSTer) written by [srg320](https://github.com/srg320)

## Installing
Copy the `.RBF` to the root of your SD card. Put some ROMs (`*.GBC`, `*.GB`) and the SGB BIOS (`*.SFC`) into SGB folder.

## Features
* MSU-1 Support
* SGB1, SGB2, and SNES clock speed toggle.
* Cheat engine.
* Save/Load Backup Game Boy RAM.

## Usage
Load your SGB BIOS from the OSD and load your Game Boy or Game Boy Color game. Here is a list of the [Super Game Boy enhanced games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Game_Boy_games) that were released for reference.

The "SGB Speed" option in the OSD allows you to change the clock speed:
* SGB1 = 4.295 MHz (2.4% faster than a real Game Boy)
* SGB2 = 4.194 MHz (The same as an original Game Boy)
* SNES = 4.220 MHz (Brings it close to the SNES's refresh rate of 60.09Hz to reduce stutter)

Press L+R at the same time to enter the Super Game Boy boot rom's menu. If you'd like to manually start the animated screensaver for the alternate borders built into the Super Game Boy, then press L, L, L, L, R in order. You will hear a ding if the border supports the screensaver animations.
