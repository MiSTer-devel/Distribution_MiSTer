# [Compukit UK101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compukit_UK101) for [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki)

Port by [danielb0](https://github.com/danielb0)

## Description

This core is a port of [Grant Searle's UK101 FPGA project](http://searle.x10host.com/uk101FPGA/index.html) to MiSTer FPGA. It is a reconstruction of a kit computer from the late 1970s, which was based on a 6502 processor that ran at 1 MHz and originally came equipped with 8Kb of RAM.

The core includes some enhancements over Grant's original project, such as extra selectable monitor software, an additional mode which simulates an Ohio Scientific computer, selectable clock speed, selectable screen modes and selectable memory sizes.

Basic programs can be loaded from text files, or via the UART at 9600 baud. Text files must have a .TXT extension. Instructions for loading can be found on Grant's page and in the [Compukit UK101 manual](http://uk101.sourceforge.net/docs/pdf/manual.pdf).
