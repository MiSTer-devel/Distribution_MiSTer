# FPGA SuperChip #

This is a Verilog implementation of the SuperChip virtual machine. The implementation can execute Chip-8 and SuperChip programs. Hybrids, the Chip-8X and MegaChip extensions are not supported.

This core has been ported from MiST to MiSTer by Paul Sajna.
Original core is by Carsten Elton SÃ¸rensen.

For an introduction to Chip-8 and SuperChip, please see [the Chip-8 article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8). 

SuperChip has traditionally been implemented as a virtual machine, but this is a pure Verilog implementation of the CPU, display and blitter. The CPU runs at a user selectable speed of a whopping 5 kHz or 12.5 kHz. An instruction usually takes 5 cycles, some a bit longer. The blitter runs at a much faster clock rate than the CPU, 50 MHz on the MiSTer, so sprite and scroll instructions only add a couple of CPU cycles.

# Instructions #

Press F12 to bring up the OSD. From here you can select a .CH8-file to load.

The Chip-8 screen aspect is 2:1 which doesn't really fit on either a 4:3 or 16:9, you can select the type of screen you're using to view the output and the core will scale the output accordingly.

The menu also allows the CPU speed to be selected. Some games are better played on slow, some on fast.

The Chip-8 machine has a hex keypad for input. This has been mapped to the PC keyboard as follows:

    Chip-8:   PS/2:
    1 2 3 C   1 2 3 4
    4 5 6 D   Q W E R
    7 8 9 E   A S D F
    A 0 B F   Z X C V
